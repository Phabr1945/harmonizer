# Harmonizer
An idea borrowed from Jacob COllier and an inspiration for this project.

## Explanation:
Basic:
```
A microphone picks up your voice, does math, and outputs a chord centered around your voice.
```

```Pick up my voice and play a 5th above it."

Beta:
```Triad with my voice.```
