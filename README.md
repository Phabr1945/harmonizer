# Harmonizer
An idea borrowed from Jacob COllier and an inspiration for this project.

## Explanation:
Basic:
```
A microphone picks up your voice, does math, and outputs a chord centered around your voice.
```

## Versions:
Alpha: ```Pick up my voice and play a 5th above it."```

Beta: ```Triad with my voice.```

## Credits

During the making of this project, there have been many repositories I have ~~taken~~ borrowed code from. Listed below are the names of those repositories.

* CheMic: https://github.com/jacobtread/chemic

# TODO:
* singing should work; either signal from windows is being too cleaned up or windows is cleaning the mic output.
